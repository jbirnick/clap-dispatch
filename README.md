# cargo-dispatch

Ergonomic way to dispatch CLI subcommands in Rust.

Useful when your CLI defines subcommands, all of which should do the same kind of action, just in a different way.
I.e., when the subcommands are variants of running a certain action.

See the [documentation](https://docs.rs/clap_dispatch).
